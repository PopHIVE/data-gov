    <li>All rates reflect events per 100,000 persons.</li>
    <li>
        Coded numerical values were introduced to denote suppressed, missing, or unreliable values.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>NA:</strong> “Not Available” or “Not Applicable”, depending on the situation 
                (<a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-expanded.html" target="_blank">CDC WONDER Documentation</a>). 
                Aggregated NA’s imply all components were NA.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>7777:</strong> Incomplete information. This was introduced during aggregation of age-groups or dates and indicates at least component was missing, NA, 8888, or 9999.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>8888:</strong> Rates are unreliable as the numerator is 20 or less.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>9999:</strong> Suppressed counts to ensure the criteria for confidentiality constraints 
                (<a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-expanded.html" target="_blank">CDC WONDER Documentation</a>). 
                Aggregated 9999 imply all components were suppressed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        HCUP’s documentation did not imply that the rates were age-adjusted, justifying all of them being labeled as crude rates, only.
    </li>
    <li>
        Age-adjusted rates are available for entries that have not been stratified by age. CDC WONDER used the 2000 Census population for age-adjustments, and SUDORS used the 2010 U.S. Census population.
    </li>
    <li>
        Underlying Cause of Death outcomes are defined by the CDC WONDER definition for that variable, and selections were made based on the UCD – Drug/Alcohol Induced Causes subset of ICD-10 codes 
        (<a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-expanded.html#Step6" target="_blank">Step 6. Select underlying cause of death</a>). 
        “All” means any available underlying cause of death code, and “Unintentional” selects Drug poisonings (overdose) Unintentional (X40-X44) and only Drug poisonings (overdose) Undetermined (Y10-Y14).
    </li>
    <li>
        Drug outcomes indicated as “All” are only present in the SUDORS dataset. These are drug overdose/poisoning events involving opioids, stimulants, depressants, or polysubstances.
    </li>
    <li>
        “All Opioids” is defined by the HCUP documentation, including ICD-10 codes T40.0 (Opium), T40.1 (Heroin), T40.2 (Other opioids), T40.3 (Methadone), T40.4 (Other synthetic narcotics), T40.6 (Other and unspecified narcotics), 
        F11.0 (Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of opioids, acute intoxication).
    </li>
    <li>
        Overdose events involving multiple drug types (polysubstances) were included for the SUDORS and CDC WONDER datasets. 
        SUDORS batches opioids plus any stimulants (including Cocaine) or depressants (including Benzodiazepines). 
        CDC WONDER only included the ICD-10 codes T42.4 (Benzodiazepines) and T40.5 (Cocaine).
