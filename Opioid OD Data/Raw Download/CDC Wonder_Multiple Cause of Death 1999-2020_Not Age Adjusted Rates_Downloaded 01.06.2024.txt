Caveats:
"1. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#2014-Revision."
"2. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of"
"death code R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality."" Caution should be used in interpreting these data."
"More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Georgia-Reporting-Anomalies."
"3. Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code"
"R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality"" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes,"
"most notably R95, ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"" and X40-X49, ""Unintentional poisoning."" Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#New-Jersey-Reporting-Anomalies."
"4. Circumstances in California resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, ""Other"
"ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality"" for deaths occurring in years 2000 and 2001. Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#California-Reporting-Anomalies."
"5. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Unreliable."
"6. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Not Stated."
"7. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"
