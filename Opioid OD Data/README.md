# Search Notes

The goal is to find nationwide data sets from unique sources (not republications of the same originating data set) that can be stratified by race, gender (or sex), and age with reports that span a number of years. These sources are then harmonized with one another for reasonable opportunities of cross-source comparisons in time-series plots.

Opioids constitute natural, semi-synthetic, and synthetic chemical materials and are reffered to by a number of clinical or slang terms; opioid(s), heroin, fentanyl, oxycontin, oxycodone, codeine, hydrocodone, and morphine being some of the most common. Most official sources will reference the opioid type by its predetermined ICD-10 code: T40 Poisoning by, adverse effect of and underdosing of narcotics and psychodysleptics hallucinogens ([ICD-10 T40 Descriptions](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/T36-T50/T40-)).

## CDC Wonder

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) online tool facilitates searching and access of public health information. The downloaded data includes stratification by state, single-year ages, gender, race, and year of observation from 1999 to 2020. Key opioid ICD-10 codes included are: T40.0 (Opium), T40.1 (Heroin), T40.2 (Other opioids), T40.3 (Methadone), T40.4 (Other synthetic narcotics), T40.5 (Cocaine), and T40.6 (Other and unspecified narcotics).

Two Multiple Cause of Death Data (Final) data sets are available for download: 1999-2020 and 2018-2022 ([Mortality Data on CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html)). The former only includes bridged race categories (4 groups) while the later allows for single race categories (6 groups, 15 groups, or single/multiple 31 groups). For easier matching between the two, only 6 groups were used for the 2018-2022 data pull. Sub date ranges were downloaded at a time for manual joining due to data size limitations for downloading.
