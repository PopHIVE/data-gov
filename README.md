## Overview

Enclosed is the code used for the first PopHIVE prototype backend and dashboard 1a. This repository includes the legacy code for regularly interacting with APIs and the scripts used to harmonize the three RSV datasets and the three Opioid Overdose datasets visualized in the dashboard. 

The code was originally copied from a repository in the [YSPH Data Science and Data Equity](https://github.com/ysph-dsde) (YSPH-DSDE) GitHub Organization and was copied into the [PopHIVE](https://github.com/PopHIVE) GitHub Organization Aug 11th, 2025. At the time of transfer, the YSPH-DSDE GitHub Organization codebase was no longer being actively contributed to and had been archived.

The initial dashboard (1a) can be found here: https://dsde.shinyapps.io/prototype/.

**Dates active:** Dec 18th â€“ Feb 6th, 2025
